 *
 * This function walks through the directory tree that is located under the uri
 * specified. It calls a walker function which is provided as a function pointer
 * once for each entry in the tree. By default, directories are handled before
 * the files and subdirectories they contain (pre-order traversal).

 *
 * @param  uri          The uri/path to the directory tree to walk.
 *
 * @param  fn           The walker function to call once for each entry.
 *
 * @param  depth        The max depth to walk down the tree.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, < 0 on error. If fn() returns non-zero, then the tree
 *         walk is terminated and the value returned by fn() is returned as the
 *         result.
